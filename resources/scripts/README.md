## Contents

This folder is meant to contain scripts to download data, set up a machine for local development, create cloud resources for training, etc.

This folder should not contain scripts specific to certain models - those belong in src/MODELNAME. This folder should not contain preprocessing or data transformation scripts - those would belong in src/common.
